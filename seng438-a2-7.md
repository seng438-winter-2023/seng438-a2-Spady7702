# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how unit tests are created in the Java language using JUnit. We will observe many kind of testing techniques, and use Mocking to assist in removing dependancies from each test that has one. We will split up the work into two groups: Ben and Brenek will primarily focus on testing the Range class, and Jack and Arion will primarily focus on the DataUtilities class. Before this lab, we all had some experience with unit testing in Java, from our provious course ENSF409. When it comes to mocking, only Jack had previous knowlegde on the subject, as he worked as a Software Quality Intern at Garmin previously, creating unit tests that involve mocking in the Python language.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

<h2>DataUtilities Testing | Jack & Arion </h2>

Before beginning testing we go through a setUp() process, in which we create a new Mockery object to mock Values2D and KeyedValues objects.

<h3>1. calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)</h3>
   
Each function utilizes as Values2D mock when summing the values in the column provided.

* First test: 'calculateColumnTotalForFourPositiveValues()' mocks a Values2D object as follows: {3.0, 2.5, 7.0, 10.5} in (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) respectively. The test method expects a sum of 23.0 to be returned.

* Second test: 'calculateColumnTotalForFourNegativeValues()' is similar to the test above, differing by only inputting negative values in the Values2D object. The mock Values2D object is as follows: {-1.0, -2.5, -7.0, -14.5} in (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) respectively. The test method expects a sum of -25.0 to be returned.

* Third test: 'exceptionThrownOnInvalidDataColumn()' provides an invalid Values2D argument. As per the documentation of calculateColumnTotal(), an 'InvalidParameterException' should be thrown. exceptionThrownOnInvalidDataColumn ensures that the proper exception is thrown from calculateColumnTotal().

We test both negative and positive numbers as a form of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. 'exceptionThrownOnInvalidDataColumn()' involves use case testing, in a scenario where a user inputs incorrect data to the function. 

<h3>2. calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)</h3>

Each function utilizes a Values2D mock when summing the values in the row provided.
   
* First test: 'calculateRowTotalForFourPositiveValues()' mocks a Values2D object as follows {3.5, 2.0, 7.5, 15.0} in (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3) respectively. The test method expects a sum of 28.0 to be returned.

* Second test: 'calculateRowTotalForFourNegativeValues()' mocks a Values2D object as follows {-2.5, -5.5, -7.5, -15.0} in (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3) respectively. The test method expects a sum of -30.5 to be returned.

* Third test: 'exceptionThrownOnInvalidDataRow()' provides an invalid Values2D argument. As per the documentation of calculateRowTotal(), an 'InvalidParameterException' should be thrown. exceptionThrownOnInvalidDataColumn ensures that the proper exception is thrown from calculateRowTotal().
    
We test both negative and positive numbers as a form of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. 'exceptionThrownOnInvalidDataRow()' involves use case testing, in a scenario where a user inputs incorrect data to the function. 

Mocking in both 'calculateColumnTotal' and 'calculateRowTotal' is useful as we do not have to rely on the Values2D class as a dependency. We are able to manufacture our expected output, and test accordingly. However due to our strong control over the test cases, we may lead to overspecification of the test case; limiting the scope of our testing. Similarly, mocking increases the complexity of the test case, making it more difficult to understand for both users and developers. 

<h3>3. createNumberArray(double[] data)</h3>

There are no mocking objects used in the following test cases.

createNumberArray takes in an array of doubles, and creates an array of Number objects.

* First test: 'createEmptyNumberArray()' creates a 'double[] data' with no values inside. It is then passed towards DataUtilities.createNumberArray() as an argument. The test case expects 'createNumberArray()' to return an empty array of Number objects.

* Second test: 'createNumberArrayPositiveValues()' passes a 'double[] data' with values = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0} into DataUtilites.createNumberArray(). The test case expects 'createNumberArray()' to return an array of Number objects = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}. 

* Third test: 'createNumberArrayNegativeValues()' passes a 'double[] data' with values = {-1.0, -2.0, -3.0, -4.0, -5.0}. It is then passed towards Data.Utilities.createNumberArray() as an argument. The test case expects 'createNumberArray()' to return an array of Number objects = {-1.0, -2.0, -3.0, -4.0, -5.0}.
    
We test both negative and positive numbers as a form of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. createEmptyNumberArray() acts as a boundary value and use case test, evaluating how the function behaves with an unexpected input. 

<h3>4. createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)</h3>

There are no mocking objects used in the following test cases.

createNumberArray2D takes in a double (2D) array of doubles, and creates a 2D array of Number objects.

* First test: 'create2DEmptyNumberArray()' creates a 'double[][] data' with no values inside. It is then passed towards DataUtilities.createNumberArray2D() as an argument. The test case expects 'createNumberArray2D()' to return an empty 2D array of Number objects.

* Second test: 'create2DNumberArrayPositiveValues()' passes a 'double[][] data' with values = {{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}, {6.0, 7.0, 8.0}, {1.0}} into DataUtilites.createNumberArray2D(). The test case expects 'createNumberArray2D()' to return a 2D array of Number objects = {{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}, {6.0, 7.0, 8.0}, {1.0}}. 

* Third test: 'create2DNumberArrayNegativeValues()' passes a 'double[] data' with values = {{-1.0, -2.0, -3.0, -4.0, -5.0}, {-6.0, -7.0, -8.0}, {-1.0}}. It is then passed towards Data.Utilities.createNumberArray2D() as an argument. The test case expects 'createNumberArray2D()' to return a 2D array of Number objects = {{-1.0, -2.0, -3.0, -4.0, -5.0}, {-6.0, -7.0, -8.0}, {-1.0}}.
    
We test both negative and positive numbers as a form of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. createEmptyNumberArray2D() acts as a boundary value and use case test, evaluating how the function behaves with an unexpected input. 

Neither createNumberArray or createNumberArray2D's tests utilize mocking, thus a discussion of mocking's benefits and drawbacks is not applicable. 

<h3>5. getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data)</h3>

Each test utilizes the KeyedValues mocking object created above. 

DataUtilities.getCumulativePercentages() receives a KeyedValues object - containing key/value pairs - and returns a KeyedValues object in which each key/value pair represents the cumulative percentage thus far of each key/value pair provided. 

* First test: 'exceptionThrownOnInvalidPercentageData()' passes an invalid argument to 'DataUtilites.getCumulativePercentages()'. Given the documentation of 'getCumulativePercentages()', the test case expects an 'InvalidParameterException' to be thrown. 

* Second test: 'cumulatePercentageForZeroValueKeyPairs()' creates a 'String[] names' with values = {"KeyOne", "KeyTwo", "KeyThree"} and a 'double[] values' with values = {0, 0, 0}. This simulates the data in a KeyedValues object as follows: (KeyOne, 0), (KeyTwo, 0), (KeyThree, 0). The test case expects 'getCumulativePercentages()' to return a NaN Divide by zero, as there should be a divide by zero error in calculating the cumulative percentage. 

* Third test: 'cumulatePercentageForPositiveValueKeyPairs()' creates a 'String[] names' with values = {"KeyOne", "KeyTwo", "KeyThree"} and a 'double[] values' with values = {5.0, 9.0, 2.0}. This simulates the data in a KeyedValues object as follows: (KeyOne, 5.0), (KeyTwo, 9.0), (KeyThree, 2.0). The test case expects 'getCumulativePercentages()' to return 0.3125 when queried for the value of the resultant KeyOne.

* Fourth test: 'cumulatePercentageForNegativeValueKeyPairs()' creates a 'String[] names' with values = {"KeyOne", "KeyTwo", "KeyThree"} and a 'double[] values' with values = {-5.0, -9.0, -2.0}. This simulates the data in a KeyedValues object as follows: (KeyOne, -.50), (KeyTwo, -9.0), (KeyThree, -2.0). The test case expects 'getCumulativePercentages()' to return 0.3125 when queried for the value of the resultant KeyOne.
    
We test both negative and positive numbers as a form of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. exceptionThrownOnInvalidPercentageData() acts as a boundary value and use case test, evaluating how the function behaves with an unexpected input, and ensuring an 'InvalidParameterException' is properly thrown. Similarly 'cumulatePercentageForZeroValueKeyPairs()' is a boundary value and use case test, as it provides an unusual input that should provide an error if handled properly. 

Mocking in 'getCumulativepercentages()' was useful in isolated the test component and functionality being testing. We effectively eliminated the KeyedValues class dependency, and were able to manufacture our expected output, and test accordingly. However the tests became significantly more complex and may not accurately reflect the behaviour of the code in a real-world scenario. Using KeyedValues objects may produce differing results. 


<h2>Range Testing | Brenek & Ben </h2>

No mocking objects were created for any of the following methods of the Range function and their repsective tests. A Range object called 'exampleRange' was created witha lower and upper bound of -1 and 1 respectively to be used in tests where neccassary. 
<h3>1. getLowerBound()</h3>

getLowerBound returns the lower bound for the created Range object. 

* First test: 'lowerBoundShouldBeNegativeOne()' uses the Range object 'exampleRange' and calls the 'getLowerBound()' function to return the lower bound for the object. The expected return value is a value of -1 for a range containing both poitive and negative values. 
* Second test: 'lowerBoundShouldBeZero()' creates a new Range object with an lower and upper bound of 0 and 100 respectively. The 'getLowerBound()' method is then called, and the expected return value is 0.
* Third test: 'lowerBoundShouldBe100()' creates a new Range object with an lower and upper bound of 100 and 200 respectively. The 'getLowerBound()' method is then called, and the expected return value is 100 for a range containing only positive values.
* Fourth test: 'lowerBoundShouldBeNegative100()' creates a new Range object with an lower and upper bound of -100 and -50 respectively. The 'getLowerBound()' method is then called, and the expected return value is -50 for a range containing only negative values.

We test both negative and positive numbers as a form of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. We test the output of ranges spanning over both positive and negative values, all positive and all negative values.

<h3>2. getUpperBound()</h3>

getUpperBound returns the upper bound for the created Range object. 

* First test: 'upperBoundShouldBeOne()' uses the Range object 'exampleRange' and calls the 'getUpperBound()' function to return the upper bound for the object. The expected return value is a value of 1 for a range containing both poitive and negative values.
* Second test: 'upperBoundShouldBeOneHundred()' creates a new Range object with an lower and upper bound of 0 and 100 respectively. The 'getUpperBound()' method is then called, and the expected return value is 100.
* Third test: 'upperBoundShouldZero()' creates a new Range object with an lower and upper bound of -50 and 0 respectively. The 'getUpperBound()' method is then called, and the expected return value is 0. 
* Fourth test: 'upperBoundShouldBeNegativeOneHundred()' creates a new Range object with an lower and upper bound of -500 and -100 respectively. The 'getUpperBound()' method is then called, and the expected return value is -100.

We test both negative and positive numbers as a form of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. We test the output of ranges spanning over both positive and negative values, all positive and all negative values. We have created tests with ranges where either the upper or lower bound is 0 in order to ensure that any unexpected behaviour is able to be observed in these situations. 

<h3>3. getLength()</h3>

getLength returns the value of the numeric range between the upper and lower bounds of the Range object. 

* First test: 'lengthShouldBeTwo()' uses the Range object 'exampleRange' and calls the 'getLength()' function to return the length of the specified range for the object. The expected return value is 2, and this test covers the scenerio where a range has both a positive and a negative bound.
* Second test: 'lengthShouldBeFifty()' creates a new Range object with an lower and upper bound of -100 and -50 respectively. The expected return value is 50, and this test covers the scenerio where a range has both bounds as negative values.
* Third test: 'lengthShouldBeOneHundred()' creates a new Range object with an lower and upper bound of -100 and 0 respectively. The expected return value is 100, and this test covers the scenerio where a range has a negative bound and a bound equal to 0.
* Fourth test: 'lengthShouldBeTen()' creates a new Range object with an lower and upper of 0 and 10 respectively. The expected return value is 10, and this test covers the scenerio where a range has both a bound that is zero and a positive value.
* Fifth test: 'lengthShouldBeTwenty()' creates a new Range object with an lower and upper bound of 20 and 40 respectively. The expected return value is 20, and this test covers the scenerio where a range has both bounds as positive values.

We test both negative and positive numbers as a form of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. We test the output of ranges spanning over both positive and negative values, all positive bounds or all negative values as bounds. We have created tests with ranges where either the upper or lower bound is 0 in order to ensure that any unexpected behaviour is able to be observed in these situations. 

<h3>4. getCentralValue()</h3>

getCentralValue returns the median value at thte middle of the upper and lower bounds of the Range object.

* First test: 'centralValueShouldBeZero()' uses the Range object 'example Range' created with an upper bound of 1 and lower bound of -1. This test expects that a value of 0 is returned after calling exampleRange.getCentralValue().
* Second test: 'centralValueShouldBeNegative150()' creates a new Range object with a lower and upper bound of (-200, -100) respectively. This test expects that a value of -150 is returned after calling exampleRange.getCentralValue(). 
* Third test: 'centralValueShouldBe150()' creates a new Range object with a upper and lower bound of (200, 100) respectively. This test expects that a value of 150 is returned after calling exampleRange.getCentralValue(). 

We test both negative and positive numbers as a form of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. We test the output of a range spanning over both positive and negative values in the 'centralValueShouldBeZero()' test.

<h3>5. contains(double value)</h3>

contains recieves a double value, returns true if the specified value is within the range, and false otherwise.

* First test: 'rangeContains100()' creates a new Range object with a lower and upper bound of 50 and 150 respectively. The double value used when calling the 'contains()' function is 100, and the expected return value is true as the value of 100 is within the range. 
* Second test: 'rangeDoesNotContain49()' creates a new Range object with a lower and upper bound of 50 and 150 respectively. The double value used when calling the 'contains()' function is 49, and the expected return value is false as the value of 49 is not within the range. This observes the scenerio where the paramter passed to the contains() function is lower than the lower bound.
* Third test: 'rangeDoesNotContain151()' creates a new Range object with a lower and upper bound of 50 and 150 respectively. The double value used when calling the 'contains()' function is 151, and the expected return value is false as the value of 151 is not within the range. This observes the scenerio where the paramter passed to the contains() function exceeds the upper bound.
* Fourth test: 'rangeContainsZero()' uses the Range object 'exampleRange' and passes a value of 0 to the 'contains()' function. The expected output is true as 0 is within the range of the object. This covers a scenerio where the value is within the range, and the range bounds are both a negative and a positive value.
* Fifth test: 'rangeDoesNotContainTwo()' uses the Range object 'exampleRange' and passes a value of 2 to the 'contains()' function. The expected output is false as 2 exceeds the upper limit of this Range object. This covers a scenerio where the value exceeds the range, and the range bounds are both a negative and a positive value.
* Sixth test: 'rangeDoesNotContainNegativeTwo()' uses the Range object 'exampleRange' and passes a value of -2 to the 'contains()' function. The expected output is false as -2 less than the lower bound of the Range object. This covers a scenerio where the value is less than the lower bound, and the range bounds are both a negative and a positive value.
* Seventh test: 'rangeContainsNegative100()' creates a new Range object with a lower and upper bound of -150 and -50 respectively. The double value used when calling the 'contains()' function is -100, and the expected return value is true as the value of -100 is within the range. Both the upper and lower bound values are negative.  
* Eighth test: 'rangeDoesNotContainNegative151()' creates a new Range object with a lower and upper bound of -150 and -50 respectively. The double value used when calling the 'contains()' function is -151, and the expected return value is false as the value of -151 is less than the lower bound.   
* Ninth Test: 'rangeDoesNotContainNegative49()' creates a new Range object with a lower and upper bound of -150 and -50 respectively. The double value used when calling the 'contains()' function is -49, and the expected return value is false as the value of -49 exceeds the range. Both the upper and lower bound values are negative.  

We test both negative and positive numbers as a form of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. The case of a value being passed to the 'contains()' that is either too large for, too small for or within the range is tested in each possible scenerio regarding the upper and lower bounds and wether or not they are positive, negative or equal to zero.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed
							       
<h2>Brenek & Ben</h2>

Brenek and Ben handled the Range test cases. Brenek was responsible for using, JUnit tests and Eclipse to implement the test cases. Ben created the test plan and helped Brenek to code a few of the unit tests. Ben and Brenek also implemented one test case each for DataUtilities, in order to learn how to use jMock. 

<h2>Jack & Arion</h2>

Jack and Arion handled the DataUtilities test cases. Jack was responsible for utilizing jMock, JUnit tests and Eclipse to implement the test cases. Arion created the test plan and aided Jack where possible in the implementation of the plan. Ben and Brenek did one mocking test each to learn the functionality of mocking in JUnit as well. 

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

<h2>Brenek & Ben</h2>

Brenek and Ben encountered dificulties, as both had never used eclipse before. They learned how to use eclipse and how to run Junit tests in eclipse, while also learning how to develop test usign jMock.

<h2>Jack & Arion</h2> 

Jack and Arion encountered difficulties figuring out the semantics behind jMock while attempting to mock Values2D and KeyedValues objects in their tests. Eventually they learned the proper syntax and gained valuable experience in jMock. 

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab was enjoyable as it allowed us to review unit testing. All of us have used JUnit in past courses, however we have not used it recently so it was nice to have a lab that walked us through writing a unit test, before we wrote one ourselves. Additionally, the lab gave very clear instructions on what we were supposed to do which was very helpul. The brief tutorial section on eclipse was also appreciated as most of us just used Visual Studio in the past.
